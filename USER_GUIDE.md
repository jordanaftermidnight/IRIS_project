## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No providers available"
```bash
# Check provider status
iris providers

# Ensure Ollama is running (for local AI)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Try specific provider
iris chat "test" --provider=groq
```

#### "Slow responses"
```bash
# Use fast provider for quick answers
iris chat "your question" --provider=groq

# Check system health
iris health

# Try task-specific routing
iris chat "your question" --task=fast
```

#### "Error: Authentication failed"
```bash
# Check if API keys are set (for external providers)
echo $GROQ_API_KEY

# Use local provider instead
iris chat "your question" --provider=ollama
```
